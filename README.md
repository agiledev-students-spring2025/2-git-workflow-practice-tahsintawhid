## An Interesting Read  
[Socal Media Threatens Teen Mental Health](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/27/social-media-threatens-teen-mental-health)  

I recently came across this article about the consequences of social media on teen mental health. The article features an interview with the Center for Humane Technology's co-founder Tristan Harris by Axios reporter Sara Fischer. In this interview, Harris talked about some issues pertaining to teenage use of social media and regulations and laws that can be used to combat some of these issues. 

One of the most striking points in the article is how the Center for Humane Technology is focusing on incentivizing big tech companies to not release AI chatbots to minors. I find the use and potential glorification of AI chatbots to have huge consequences on human behavior and health in the next few decades, especially since many people are already struggling to manage their mental health because of social media.  

## Why This Matters  

Understanding the impact of social media on mental health is important for developers and designers building digital platforms. The choices we make while developing our software can have consequences on the greater population. Therefore, we will need to promote postiive interactions and give users more control over their experience to help lower the negative effects of social media apps. As technology evolves, the focus on its psychological and sociological implications must also grow.

Hey, I have read the posted article and I strongly agree with its contents. As someone who has previously been addicted to scrolling on social media, I believe social media has its harmful effects and must be addressed. Perhaps some legal regulation on the algorithms and data collection systems run on social media platforms by big tech companies. This could be one way to lead a brighter future.
